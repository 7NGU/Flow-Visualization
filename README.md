# Flow-Visualization


By using the method of information entropy screening and feature line extraction, the mutual occlusion between the flow field and the flow line can be reduced, and the characteristics of the flow field can be displayed more clearly, and parallel processing can be performed, which makes the program good processing power and operation speed.
